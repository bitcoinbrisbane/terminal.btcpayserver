# terminal.btcpayserver
A simple React front end for BTC Pay Server

## Motivation

Many crypto brick and morart merchants us a tablet with a wallet to take payments.  They do not often have an inventory based crypto POS, but use a crypto facility like a card payment processor.

The work flow is generally:
* Shop operator scans or enters items into their POS
* The total is calcualted in the local fiat currency
* The equvalate amount is then entered into smartphone or tablet crypto wallet for crypto payments.
